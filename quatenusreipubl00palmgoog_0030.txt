n “ Is aman compotently acquainted with the civil law should
look into our own, he would first bo struck with the great number
of Latin termo, some used in the Roman oense, some muoh per-
verted from their original meaning. If he examined tho mles οἰ
law, and chiefly those relating to property, contracto, and the in-
terpretation of testamento, he would often find them the same,
evenis tho termo differed: ond thio not only in that part of the
low called equity, and in the law administered in the ecclesiastice]
oourts ond some other couno, but also in what we call the common

Ι low.”-Long, Two Disoournes‚ p. 89.
